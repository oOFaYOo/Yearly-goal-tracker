# Yearly goal tracker

A small personal project that uses a fake backend simulation, allows you to register and create your own goals for the year, add steps to complete the goal. Goals can be deleted, steps in existing goals can be edited, deleted and added. For the convenience of selecting goals, there is sorting, searching and filtering.
If you are too lazy to register and set goals, use the "Demo user" button on the authorization page.
Using: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, React Testing Library, Jest, Material UI.  
Tested only on Google Chrome.
